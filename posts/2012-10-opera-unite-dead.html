    <h1>Opera Unite is dead</h1>
<div><p>So it turns out I was right in <a href="http://sharovatov.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/opera-revolution-fail/">my earlier blogpost</a> about Opera’s so-called “web revolution” and “reinventing the web” marketing bluff – it was a dead end right from the start.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://my.opera.com/addons/blog/2012/04/24/sunsetting-unite-and-widgets">officially noted on the Opera blog</a>, Opera Unite has been discontinued from the 24<sup>th</sup> April 2012 with Opera 12 release.</p>
<p>Not a big surprise at all.</p>
