    <h1>proper iOS pull-to-refresh</h1>
<div><p>Most of the pull-to-refresh plugins or concepts I saw had drawbacks - some emulated native scroll with JS (seems slower and non-native to me), others (mobile gmail) hid scrollbar altogether, <a href="http://cubiq.org/dropbox/iscroll4/examples/pull-to-refresh/">others</a> made scrollbar appear as if some content is already scrolled. </p>
<p>As no available app seemed good enough for me and project requirements required iOS only, I drafted <a href="https://github.com/sharovatov/my/tree/master/js_experiments/ios_pull-to-refresh">this</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, everything what needs to be hardware accelerated, is actually accelerated.</p>
<p><a href="http://sharovatov.ru/ptr/ptr.html">The testcase</a> seems to perform quite well on all my target platforms - iPhone4, 4s and 5.</p>
